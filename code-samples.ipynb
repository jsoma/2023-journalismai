      "- 1 cup granulated sugar\n",
      "- 1 cup packed brown sugar\n",
      "- 2 large eggs\n",

      "- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 2 cups chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)\n",

      "1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\n",

       "\" Okay, I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the program, what exactly goes on and... Okay, well basically it's an intensive program designed to last four weeks, in session four weeks long, although we do have two sessions in 1996 that will be two weeks long. But our general four week session involves seven hours of contact each day of Spanish. It involves starting at 9 o'clock in the morning with three hours of grammar instruction, and then it's followed immediately by an hour of group conversation with the same instructors, same class, but we have extensive gardens here at Institute and so students will usually know how to a garden setting because it's a bit more comfortable. And then after a break for lunch, students return and we have a complete flip of instruction and that instead of textbook and clinical type instruction, we have hands-on and we have we offer workshops and me-hey-backstrap weaving, regional cooking of Wahaka at Zompusnell pottery, and if we have large groups, we also offer folklore dance and those are two hours a day, Monday through Thursday. And they're really in place, not so much to teach students a craft, but they're in place to facilitate Spanish language acquisition with the hands-on project. It's our our belief that using the language will give students an opportunity to have better retention. You can use it, they feel a little bit more comfortable, the vocabulary expands and whatnot. And then the last hour is a daily intercombo hour, and that's where someone from the community in Wahaka comes to the Institute and they work with one of our students one on one as a conversation partner. And if the students here at the Institute were English speaking, English being their native language, then half the time would be an English, half the time would be in Spanish. And we offer included in the course our lectures, weekly lectures, and we have films and other cultural presentations. And all that is included within the same package. We also offer optional tours on the weekends, going to points of interest around Wahaka. I don't know if you're familiar with Wahaka, but it's really rich with archaeological sites and indigenous marketplaces and craft villages. So there's a lot to see. Is this the program geared primarily toward beginning level? No, we offer seven different levels ranging from true beginners, people who know absolutely nothing about Spanish all the way up through advanced and literature levels. So we have something for everybody. When you arrive, we would give you a placement test. It's a two-part test. The first part is written. And it would test you on President Tans, direct and indirect objects, goes all the way to subjective and then you actually do some writing as well. And after an instructor would grade that, then they would speak with you. And that would be the second portion of the test. They would ask you a lot of questions about why you're here studying Spanish, where you're from, why are you interested in Spanish in particular as opposed to some other language, how you visited other places within Mexico and whatnot. They're really zeroing in, how you use the language when you're speaking. And that helped them to more fine tune where they placed you. How many people are in each group? We have a maximum according to our brochure as Tan, although we have never had a group of Tan, averages more around six and it can be lower. We've had groups of one before. So a group, I don't think that's a group. How long is the program? It's designed to last four weeks, but students can come by the week if they wish. We advise if they do come by the week that they try to come at the beginning of the session so they don't have instructional gaps. For example, if the class is going on three weeks, then we suddenly have a student arrive the end of the second or third week. It can be a little bit difficult and that student will enter into a class that's been in session already two or three weeks. We frequently do have students who don't arrive at the beginning because their schedules don't allow them to have conformity to our schedule. And they do it. I have been a student here several times myself. I'm now the assistant director. When I first came, I came the last two weeks of the December session and the first two weeks of the January session. It was doable. It was difficult the last two weeks, but I did it. It was the only time I had to operate with. It was alright. Of course, the January session when I started with the rest of the group at the beginning of the session was more easy to feel the flow of the class right away because the ground rules were there in front of me. And are the accommodations there on premises or... No. We offer several options. The vast majority of our students take host family homes as the way to go when they're here in Waxaca. They pay a base price of $11 a day and that includes a private room and full breakfast. And it may or may not include a private bath. It really depends on each family. It's not a hotel. It's a home. And the idea isn't so much for luxury. It's more for really communicating with people and to get to know the culture by way of the people. And the vast majority of the homes are up from middle class to lower upper class. The very nice home is when the families that we've worked with for years. If a student wishes other meals with the host family, for an additional $4 a day, the student can have commedit, which is the large midday meal. As you can eat very, very well in Waxaca on $4, but the $4 meal would be primarily for the purposes of interacting with the host family. And then there's the saying out, which is the very light, very late evening meal. That's anywhere between 730, 9 o'clock at night. That's an additional $2. It can be a simple as panel say and a cup of hot chocolate. And it's not formal. It's not formal. It's not formal meal the way the saying is. Would it be possible to accommodate vegetarians? Oh yeah, we do that all the time. We're very used to it. Especially here in Waxaca, well, in Mexico in general, with tortillas and beans and all the well-to-fruits and vegetables, it would be very simple. If students don't want to homstay and they wish to have alternative accommodations, we can help with apartments and hotels and that sort of thing. They would need to send the deposit. A lot of people when they call us, they don't really speak enough Spanish. They don't feel comfortable enough with their Spanish to make reservations. Other hotels close by. Flots. Okay. The F is that you offer workshops and cooking as well. We being in pottery. And sometimes, camps. Folklark camps. And that's all incorporated into the program. Uh-huh. That would also be for six weeks, if you say. No four weeks. Before weeks. I see. And could you give me some ideas to what the price might be? Okay, the price is at $1,50 registration fee and $400 for the session or $100 by the week. Or $100 by the week. Okay. Um, and do you have any more printed information on? We have a brochure. Uh-huh. Would it be possible that send me one? Sure will. Let me grab a piece of paper hold on just one moment. Okay. Okay. My name is Richard Ganneth. Did you start your last thing? Yeah. G-A-N-I-S. Hasn't Sam. And my address is... G-A-N-I-S. Right. Okay. I heard an F there. Okay. Uh-huh. And my address is $602. Herst Avenue. H-E-A-R-S-P. Herst Avenue in Berkeley. California. And I can believe it's my grandmother that lived on herst Avenue for years. Oh really? There's now a park there along along Park State State. Yeah, a lot of people are there. They demolished her house, which is too bad. Which is it? And it's $9.4. $7.03. Okay. Yeah, they're right across the park there. Yeah. No, there was a railroad track or something that were there. And I remember playing there when we visited it a couple of times when I was a child. I went back for the first time in years, just about two years ago and I was done to see that the house was completely gone and there was a park in the place. It's like a dog park now. They let the dogs on this. Yeah. That'll be good. Well, I'm going to repeat this address back to make sure that I've got it right. Okay. I've got Richard Gannis, G-A-N-I-S, $602. Herst Avenue, H-E-A-R-S-P. Berkeley, California, 94703. Right. Okay. Good day. Great. I appreciate that. Well, you're welcome. And I appreciate you letting this call be recorded as well. That's fine. Okay. Thanks for your attention. Bye-bye.\""
